# AI FAQ

## Is AI the same as LLM?

No. AI is a broader field; LLMs are one major approach.

## Why do hallucinations happen?

Models generate probabilistically and may produce plausible but incorrect facts.
Use retrieval, citations, and human review for critical outputs.

## When should I use RAG?

Use RAG when answers depend on internal documents or frequently updated data.

## Prompt optimization vs fine-tuning?

Start with prompt optimization first (faster and cheaper).
Use fine-tuning only when strict consistency is required.

## How do I reduce AI risk?

- Add human review for external-facing content
- Mask sensitive data before sending to models
- Keep logs for audit and traceability
