# Tools & Resources

A practical index of learning and implementation resources.

## Learning Tracks

1. Fundamentals: Transformer, token, context window
2. Engineering: Prompt, RAG, Agent, evaluation
3. Operations: cost, monitoring, permission, security

## Common Tooling

| Category | Examples | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration | LangChain / LlamaIndex | AI workflows and knowledge QA |
| Vector DB | Milvus / Weaviate / Chroma | Semantic retrieval |
| Inference | vLLM / Ollama / TGI | Local/private model serving |
| Evaluation | Ragas / promptfoo | Quality assessment |

## Practical Advice

- Define metrics before building
- Start from an MVP
- Keep prompt/parameter/output logs for iteration
